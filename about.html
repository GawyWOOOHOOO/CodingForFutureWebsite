                <h1>Mission Statement </h1>
                <p>CFF is dedicated to enhancing coding abilities and fostering a 
                    deeper appreciation for computer science. Our goal is to increase 
                    diversity in coding fields by providing resources, workshops, and 
                    opportunities to underrepresented communities. We aim to spark children's 
                    interest in coding by organizing engaging and interactive activities that 
                    introduce basic programming concepts. Additionally, we support students from 
                    low-income areas and schools without AP Computer Science courses by giving 
                    them the opportunity to take the AP Exam and pursue a career in computer science.

                        <p>Sibo Tao, a junior at Yorba Linda High School, is one of the co-founders of Coding For Future. His passion for computer science began during a visit to his brother at UCI's game development summer school program, where he discovered his interest in designing and building video games. Since then, he has delved into various fields of computer science, including game development, web development, data science, and programming in general.<br><br>

                            While forced to enroll in expensive and tedious coding courses, Sibo came up with the idea of starting a nonprofit organization that provides free and interactive programming resources. In his free time, he enjoys visiting zoos and aquariums to observe cute animals, competing with his friend Peixuan in different board games, and playing badminton.</p>

                        <p>Ethan Yang was born in West Covina, California, and he is currently attending Yorba Linda High School in the graduating class of 2024. Ever since his teacher presented Scratch to him 8 years ago, he has developed a love and great interest for coding.  He began enthusiastically learning more and more about coding, leading him to create his own games and websites. The fact that coding has the potential to pave a path for unlimited creativity was why Ethan found it so fascinating and fun. From an early age, Ethan has also possessed the passion to make a difference in the lives of others and share his own joyful experiences with those around him. <br><br>As such, when Ethan co-founded Coding For Future, he was able to successfully incorporate both his passions perfectly. One of the things that Ethan loves about the program is that children are able to form meaningful friendships and memorable experiences in each and every event he holds. It is this very fact that motivates Ethan to continue to lead this program in the future.</p>

                        <p>Peixuan Li, a junior at Yorba Linda High School, enjoys tinkering with computer hardware or coding software with a deep interest in the inner workings of computer systems. He is likely to be highly motivated and driven by his desire to create and innovate. His first contact with computers began in the computer lab during elementary school. After learning block coding, he realized that coding supplied endless freedom and creativity. He signed up for more advanced computer science classes during his first year of high school and learned more real coding. Since then, his interest in computers has only grown. <br><br>When he heard his friend Sibo's idea of starting a coding non-profit organization, he was the first to support him. He hopes to help others learn to code, especially those who don’t have access to the materials and hardware required. During his free time, he creates computer projects with Sibo. These projects help the community and environment. They’ve even submitted their projects to competitions, in hopes of winning awards.</p>
